# My-first-HTML-CSS-website-prototype


Firstly, open up Index.html

By pressing the little light symbol in the top of the page, it'll turn into either dark mode or light mode depending on which is currently open.

This is just a prototype of a website, so it doesn't fully work along with JS or SQL for example. 

This was originally made for a final project for my first semester at a system development technical course at COTUCA.
